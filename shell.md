# Shell

[Spring Shell](https://projects.spring.io/spring-shell/) version 2 comes with [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) support. Now it is much easier to run the shell. Also, it is easier to test the shell code in unit tests.

In the new version, it is possible to create own annotations and wrap them around commands using AOP \(this was not possible in the first version\).
